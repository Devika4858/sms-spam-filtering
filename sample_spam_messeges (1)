4. You have a new billing statement

Getting text notifications from your service provider about processed, pending, or upcoming invoices is typical. But how can you be sure these texts are reliable without going through the verification process? Criminals use this tactic to lure victims into disclosing personal and financial data. One example of a billing statement spam text is:

Your new billing statement for April is now available online. To view your statement and make a payment, please follow the link below: [link]
Greetings [Name], your AT&T billing invoice is ready for review. To avoid an extra fee, please pay by the specified date: [link]. Thank you!


5. Congratulations, You won!

Receiving an unexpected award is always a delightful surprise. However, if you are notified of winning a contest through text message with no prior knowledge or participation, then it’s time to raise your suspicions. Whenever feelings of uncertainty about the integrity of an offer arise, reach out to the company directly to ensure authenticity. Some examples of spam texts regarding winning imaginary contests are:

Congratulations! You’ve won a free iPhone 12. To claim your prize, please follow the link below: [link]
You have been chosen to receive a one-time $500 shopping voucher! Click [link] to redeem your offer now.
6. Verify your bank account details

Recent frauds in the name of renowned banking firms, such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase, have caused immense customer damage by compromising their financial data. Remembering that a legitimate business will only seek your confidential personal or fiscal info over text messages is critical. So if you receive an unexpected verification SMS from your bank, it’s most likely malicious!

Be careful of fraud alerts, as scammers often use them to exploit your sentiments. While you may think that activating these alert services is a way to protect yourself from potential financial loss, it gives these malicious actors the details needed to gain access and steal away all your money. Here are some examples of bank spam texts:

Your Wells Fargo account has been temporarily locked due to possible suspicious activity. Please log in here and promptly verify your information for security purposes.
[Name], did you recently apply for a loan? Please verify your bank account details here: [Link]
7. Verify your Apple iCloud ID

Unsolicited texts with requests to verify an Apple ID are becoming increasingly more common as cybercriminals spread scams through social engineering techniques. The goal is to trick users into giving away their usernames and password by clicking on the link in the text, unknowingly revealing all of their personal information. An example of an iCloud ID spam text is:

Your Apple ID has been identified as a possible security breach. To protect your account, please verify your Apple ID and password here: [link]
Confirm your identity with Apple by clicking this link:[link]. Thank you!
8. A family member needs some help

One of the most alarming spam text messages makes you think a loved one needs urgent financial assistance. By pretending to be someone else, they try and persuade you into wiring money due to an alleged medical crisis or abduction situation involving your relative. Such malicious attempts are deceptive and can cause significant distress and even panic among family members who have no clue it’s only a scam.

Exercise caution and reach out to the family member before taking action. Contacting relevant authorities before dispatching financial aid would be prudent for emergencies. Here are some examples:

This is an emergency. Your brother needs help. He has been taken hostage, and the ransom to free him is $2,000. Wire money ASAP
Your mother was in a car accident. She requires immediate medical attention. Please send money via Western Union to [Name]
9. Reactivate your account

This type of spam text message is sent by malicious actors who pretend to be a legitimate company or service provider and ask you to reconnect your account. It usually includes a link that looks like it’s from the original business but leads you to an illegitimate website designed to steal personal data. The key here is to not fall for the trick, as it can give these fraudsters access to your identity and finances.

For example, a fake text message may tell you to reactivate your credit card or online banking account:

We noticed some unusual activity on your bank card. Please reactivate your account here [link]
Your Amazon account has been suspended. Please click here to reactivate your account now.
10. Receive your Bitcoin Gift

This is a common scam that has been around for a while, as it typically targets those who need to be better versed in cryptocurrency. Scammers send persuasive messages with monetary incentives, such as “you have been gifted Bitcoin” or “you have won a cryptocurrency contest.” Then they ask you to download an app and enter your personal information in exchange for the reward. Do not fall into this trap — it’s a desperate attempt to steal your identity and money.

To spot a Bitcoin spam text message, look out for phrases like:

Congratulations, you have been gifted 0.5 BTC. Click here to claim it now!
You have won a Bitcoin contest! Click here to receive your prize.
